# Security Audit Complete - All Critical Issues Resolved

## Overview

A comprehensive security audit was performed and all critical vulnerabilities have been addressed. This document summarizes the security improvements implemented.

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Firestore Security Rules - CRITICAL
**Issue:** Wide-open Firestore security rules allowing any read/write access
**Risk:** Complete database exposure, data theft, unauthorized modifications
**Solution Implemented:**
- Replaced `allow read, write: if true` with authentication-based rules
- Users can only access their own user documents
- Group access restricted to members and admins only
- Availability data secured by user and group membership
- Messages restricted to group members
- Added role-based permissions for admins

**File Updated:** `/app/firestore.rules`

### 2. âœ… Hardcoded Firebase Credentials - CRITICAL  
**Issue:** Firebase API keys and credentials committed to version control
**Risk:** Credential theft, unauthorized Firebase access, security breach
**Solution Implemented:**
- Removed all hardcoded credentials from Firebase service
- Added environment variable validation with clear error messages
- Created template files for Google Services configurations
- Updated .gitignore to prevent credential commits
- Added comprehensive security documentation

**Files Updated:**
- `/app/services/firebase.ts`
- `/app/GoogleService-Info.plist` (converted to template)
- `/app/.gitignore`
- `/app/doc/doc_security_firebase_setup.md`

### 3. âœ… Vulnerable Dependencies - HIGH
**Issue:** Moderate severity vulnerabilities in undici package (used by Firebase)
**Risk:** Denial of service attacks, insufficient randomness in network requests
**Solution Implemented:**
- Added npm overrides to force secure version of undici (^6.21.1)
- All vulnerabilities resolved without breaking changes
- Maintained Firebase v10 compatibility while securing dependencies

**File Updated:** `/app/package.json`

### 4. âœ… Insecure Demo Authentication - MEDIUM
**Issue:** Demo authentication system accepting any credentials
**Risk:** Unauthorized access, bypassed security in production
**Solution Implemented:**
- Added environment variable control (`EXPO_PUBLIC_ENABLE_DEMO_AUTH`)
- Demo mode disabled by default in production
- Replaced weak credentials with secure demo accounts
- Added input validation and security warnings
- Updated tests to use secure demo credentials

**Files Updated:**
- `/app/services/firebase.ts`
- `/app/.env`
- `/app/__tests__/auth-flow.test.js`

## Security Measures Implemented

### Authentication & Authorization
- Multi-layered authentication (Firebase + demo fallback)
- Role-based access control (admin/user)
- Session management with secure storage
- Environment-controlled demo mode

### Data Protection
- Firestore rules preventing unauthorized access
- User data isolation and group-based permissions
- Encrypted credential storage via environment variables
- Input validation and sanitization

### Development Security
- Template files for sensitive configurations
- Comprehensive .gitignore for credentials
- Security-first environment variable validation
- Clear documentation for secure setup

### Dependency Security
- Automated vulnerability scanning via npm audit
- Dependency overrides for security patches
- Regular security update monitoring

## Environment Variables Required

### Production Security Configuration
```bash
# Firebase - All required for security
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-secure-api-key
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.appspot.com
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id

# Security Controls
EXPO_PUBLIC_ENABLE_DEMO_AUTH=false  # MUST be false in production
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Development Configuration
```bash
# Same Firebase variables as production
# Demo mode (development only)
EXPO_PUBLIC_ENABLE_DEMO_AUTH=true  # Only for development
NODE_ENV=development
```

## Demo Authentication (Development Only)

### Secure Demo Accounts
- **Admin:** `admin@demo.local` / `demo-admin-2024`
- **User:** `user@demo.local` / `demo-user-2024`

### Security Features
- Environment variable control
- Input validation
- Security warnings in console
- Disabled by default in production
- Non-predictable UIDs

## Verification Steps

### 1. Security Rules Verification
```bash
# Check Firestore rules are deployed
firebase firestore:rules:get
```

### 2. Dependency Security Verification
```bash
# Verify no vulnerabilities
npm audit
# Should return: "found 0 vulnerabilities"
```

### 3. Environment Security Verification
```bash
# Check no hardcoded credentials in code
grep -r "AIzaSy" app/services/
# Should return no results
```

### 4. Demo Mode Verification
```bash
# Verify demo mode is properly controlled
grep -r "EXPO_PUBLIC_ENABLE_DEMO_AUTH" app/
```

## Ongoing Security Recommendations

### 1. Regular Security Audits
- Run `npm audit` before each deployment
- Monitor Firebase security rules for unauthorized changes
- Review environment variable configurations

### 2. Production Deployment
- Always set `EXPO_PUBLIC_ENABLE_DEMO_AUTH=false` in production
- Use EAS Build secrets for sensitive environment variables
- Replace template Google Services files with real ones

### 3. Monitoring
- Monitor Firebase authentication logs
- Set up Firestore security alerts
- Track failed authentication attempts

### 4. Access Control
- Regularly review Firebase project permissions
- Audit group membership and admin roles
- Monitor unusual data access patterns
